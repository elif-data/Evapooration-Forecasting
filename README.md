Here's how I tackled a tricky data challenge at our construction site - we had no temperature or evaporation readings to work with.

I found a nearby city that had both measurements, and I already knew how the temperature changed across the area. By using the coordinates of both sites and I gained an understanding of what the construction site's temperatures would have been.

Then, for the nearing city, I fitted the most suitable regression model to it's temperature and evaporation  data to establish the correlation between them. 

Finally, I used that model to forecast the evaporation in the construction site.
